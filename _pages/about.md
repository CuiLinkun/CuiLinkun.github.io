 <p>I am a first-year graduate student (2025.09 - Present) in <a href='https://cies.hhu.edu.cn/'>College of Computer Science and Software Engineering</a> at <a href='https://www.hhu.edu.cn/'>Hohai University</a>, majoring in Electronic Information. I obtained my B.Sc. degree in Internet of Things Engineering from <a href='https://www.qlu.edu.cn/'>Qilu University of Technology</a> in 2024, with a GPA of 3.8/5.0 (top 15% in my major).<br><br>         My graduate supervisor is <a href='https://lyushenhuan.github.io/' target='_blank'>Prof. Shenhuan Lyu</a>(吕沈欢教授). My research interests focus on <b>edge computing</b>, <b>deep learning</b>, and <b>intelligent applications of embedded systems</b>. During my undergraduate studies, I independently developed an elderly fall detection intelligent patch and participated in the development of a wood factory environment monitoring system, accumulating experience in STM32, MPU6050, ESP8266, and MQTT protocol. I also have practical experience in embedded hardware debugging and software development through an internship.

# 📚 Research & Project Experience

## Independent Development Projects
- <b>Elderly Fall Detection Intelligent Patch Design and Implementation</b> (2024.02 - 2024.06)<br>
  Role: Independent Developer<br>
  Description: Designed a hardware-software collaborative fall detection system based on STM32 MCU and multi-sensor fusion. The hardware integrated MPU6050 6-axis sensor to monitor 3-axis acceleration in real time, used convolutional neural network (CNN) to train the fall detection algorithm, and added GPS and NFC modules (for real-time location tracking and elderly information storage). The communication layer adopted ESP8266 WiFi to upload data to the cloud via MQTT protocol.

## Collaborative Development Projects
- <b>Wood Factory Environment Monitoring System</b> (2023.03 - 2023.06)<br>
  Role: Assistant Software Developer<br>
  Description: Participated in data collection of multi-sensor based on STM32 environment monitoring system, realized data upload to cloud via ESP8266 and MQTT protocol. Assisted in the development of face recognition module and APP remote monitoring interface, supporting real-time data display and over-limit early warning.
